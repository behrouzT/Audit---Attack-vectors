# Access Control

There are a number of common mistakes relating to access control.

## Default Visibility

The default visibility of solidity functions/state variables is `public`. Developers may forget to specify the visibility for a function/state variable that is intended to be private.

## Authentication With tx.origin

Sometimes developer use tx.origin instead of msg.sender. Tx.origin returns the address of the account that originally sent the call. Use this varible for authenticating leaves contract vulnerable to a phising-like attack.

## Signature Verification

It is a common pattern for smart contract systems to allow users to sign messages off-chain instead of directly requesting users to do an on-chain transaction because of the flexibility and increased transferability that this provides. Smart contract systems that process signed messages have to implement their own logic to recover the authenticity from the signed messages before they process them further. A limitation for such systems is that smart contracts can not directly interact with them because they can not sign messages. Some signature verification implementations attempt to solve this problem by assuming the validity of a signed message based on other methods that do not have this limitation. An example of such a method is to rely on msg.sender and assume that if a signed message originated from the sender address then it has also been created by the sender address. This can lead to vulnerabilities especially in scenarios where proxies can be used to relay transactions.

### Remediation

It is not recommended to use alternate verification schemes that do not require proper signature verification through `ecrecover()`.

## Unprotected Ether Withdrawal

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can withdraw some or all Ether from the contract account.

This bug is sometimes caused by unintentionally exposing initialization functions. By wrongly naming a function intended to be a constructor, the constructor code ends up in the runtime byte code and can be called by anyone to re-initialize the contract.

## Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.

## Missed Modifier

It is important to have access control validations on critical functions that execute actions like modifying the owner, transfer of funds and tokens, pausing and unpausing the contracts, etc. Missing validations either in the modifier or inside require or conditional statements will most probably lead to compromise of the contract or loss of funds.

## Incorrect Modifier Names

Due to the developer’s mistakes and spelling errors, it may happen that the name of the modifier or function is incorrect than intended. Malicious actors may also exploit it to call the critical function without the modifier, which may lead to loss of funds or change of ownership depending on the function’s logic.

## Overpowered Roles

Allowing users to have overpowered roles may lead to vulnerabilities. The practice of least privilege must always be followed in assigning privileges.
