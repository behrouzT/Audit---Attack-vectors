# Smart contract attack vectors
The objective of this repository is to gather a comprehensive list of potential attack vectors that could compromise smart contracts, as
 well as resources for learning how to prevent them. We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests, ranging from minor 
 documentation adjustments to the addition of new tools or resources.
